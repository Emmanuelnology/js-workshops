Craig has 5 pets, create a test Runner to test the conditional logic.
Create a function called test that takes three arguments,  an expression,  a boolean and the name for the test. The function should test the expression against the boolean and display the result of the test clearly in the console.

Create another function called showResults. this function should summarise the number of total tests run and the total number of successful tests clearly in the console.

test(name=='Craig', true, 'name is Craig');
showResults();

Output:

Test 'name is Craig': Pass
